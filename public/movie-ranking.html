<h1>The best movies according to DiegoVolkx</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Infinity war</h3>
<p>Until now it is my favorite superhero movie. It was the first movie I watched of Marvel, and the one that made me start watching that universe since the beginning. Amazing CGI, story, music, and just everything seems to be perfect.</p>
<p>Quote from the movie: <br /> <br />
"I finally rest and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.<br />
The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
</p>
<h3>The Karate Kid</h3>
<p>I love this movie. It is about a guy who is bullied and starts learning martial arts (karate specifically) from a Japanese man. Very inspiring</p>
<p>Quote from the movie: <br /> <br />
"Man who catch fly with chopstick, <br />
accomplish anything."
</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>One of the best sci-fi movies of all time, in my opinion. It shows how the main character discovers that the world is just a simulation and everything around him is fake, and he is giving a choice to forget everything and live in ignorance, or escape from the matrix and experience the real world. You can easily draw out a very philosophical discussion from the movie.</p>
<p>Quote from the movie: <br /> <br />
"The Matrix is everywhere. <br />
It is all around us. <br />
Even now, in this very room. <br />
You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. <br /> 
You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. <br /> 
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth."
